Here are the key steps:

Started by addressing missing values in the dataset. You can handle this by filling in the missing values with the mean for numerical columns and the mode for categorical columns.
Ensure that the data types of the columns are appropriate. Specifically, make sure to convert the 'posting_date' column to a datetime data type.
Utilize the 'posting_date' column to create a datetime index for the dataset. This will facilitate the analysis of temporal patterns.
With clean data, explore it using various visualizations and statistical analysis techniques. This step is crucial for understanding temporal patterns, identifying seasonal trends, and analyzing demand-supply dynamics by region and vehicle type.
Build the time-series chart.
